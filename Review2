Review
We learned all about how to use TypeScript to specify the types of function parameters and return types. Now we know how to:

Give type annotations to function parameters.
Deal with type annotations for optional parameters, which may have default values.
Understand how TypeScript determines the return type of a function.
Explicitly specify return types for functions, including for functions that donâ€™t return anything.
Use the above skills to diagnose and fix bugs in our code.
Great job!
